# Survivors-Of-Titanic
Titanic was a British passenger ship that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean, after striking an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. The following Kaggle (Competition) dataset consists of a number of features, based on these features we can analyze the number of survivors and the various factors that led to their survival. In addition to we can create a predictive model that can be used to predict the outcome of a given data, thus based on certain feature we can identify whether or not a passenger has survived.
